# Hello-World
This is my first GitHub repo. Learning from the GitHub guide. And I like bananas.

I'm currently learning unreal engine and blender, so I can make my own indie games. I also love to play football(or soccer for my US fellows). 

Fav club - PSG
Fav players- Ramos, Messi, Neymar, MBappe, Ronaldo and man others.
hated players- Harry maguire when he scored own goal for Man United.

Yes, That's it now.
